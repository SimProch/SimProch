## About me

Hello there, pleasure to see you around partner.

I'm Simon and I'm currently working as a full-stack developer at [Level.works](https://nl.level.works/).

In the past, I've been working as a developer and mentor, but nowadays I'm just coding at Level and playing around with my [blog](https://blog.simproch.dev/).

Should you like to reach me, make sure to visit my homepage where you can find links to all my socials, or contact me at [my mail](mailto:simon@simproch.dev).
